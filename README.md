SpriteKit-Programming-Guide-Swift
=================================

This is Apple's official SpriteKit Programming Guide coding with Swift.

As long as Apple has not updated their Swift programming guide for SpriteKit, I translated it and did some trivial modifications. The project is compatible with Xcode 6.1 GM 2. 

The image assets which are used only for this demonstration are collected from the internet.
